### **Dependencies**

This project leverages Jupyter Lab v3.4.4 and Python version 3.9.13 packaged by conda-forge | (main, May 27 2022, 17:01:00) with the following packages:


* [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) - module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.

* [relativedelta](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/relativedelta.html) - from dateutil, is designed to be applied to an existing datetime and can replace specific components of that datetime, or represents an interval of time.

* [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#module-json) - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format inspired by JavaScript object literal syntax; exposes an API familiar to users of the standard library marshal and pickle modules.

* [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html) - is a means of tracking events that happen when some software runs; developer adds logging calls to their code to indicate that certain events have occurred. An event is described by a descriptive message which can optionally contain variable data.
